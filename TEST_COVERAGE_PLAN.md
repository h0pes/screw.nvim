- Enhance vim API mocking for signs and UI features

### 2. Incremental Implementation
- Start with collaboration core, then storage backends  
- Focus on critical paths and error scenarios
- Ensure each test is independent and reproducible
- Add integration tests for complete workflows

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Update test documentation as coverage expands
- Document test utilities and mocking strategies
- Maintain test coverage metrics
- Create testing guidelines for contributors

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Ensure tests cover real user workflows
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate error messages and user feedback
- Performance considerations for large datasets

## Priority Legend
